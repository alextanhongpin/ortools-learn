    "Ma√ßka Police Station employs 30 police officers. Each officer works for 5 days per week. The crime rate fluctuates with the day of week, so the number of the police officers required each day depends on which day of the week it is: Monday, 18; Tuesday, 24; Wednesday, 25; Thursday, 16; Friday, 21; Saturday, 28; Sunday, 18. The Police Station wants to schedule police officers to minimize the number whose days off are not consecutive. Formulate an LP that will accomplish this goal. "
